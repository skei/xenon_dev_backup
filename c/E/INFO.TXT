Chaotic documentation:

This is more like a dump of the structures in my own 3d engine

Most fields should be pretty easy to understand. The mode diffuse ones
are:

Mat_Flags : 1 Texture
            2 Opacity
            4 Reflection
            8 Bump
Obj_Flags : 1 active
            2 mapped (has u/v coordinates)
Obj_Sphere : Diameter of bounding sphere
Obj_NumNormals : I decided to have a separate list of normals (& u/v
                 coordinates), and each vertex & polygon have a pointer to
                 the normal it should use..
                 I will pre-process the object: compare the normals, and
                 remove duplicate, identical normals. Then have the
                 pointers point to the same normal.
                 This way I need less normals - and processing normals for
                 shading, etc runtime will be less time-consuming.
                 Additionally, this is needed for fixing the U/V wrapping
                 bug found in most other engines.
Obj_NormalUV : When I load the 3DS file, I create the same number of
               Normals as the number of vertices, and let each vertex
               point to the same normal-number. And I just load the U/V
               coordinates into the normal structures...
               Post-processing after loading the 3ds, may result in a
               change here, due to equal normals, fixing u/v wrapping etc,
               etc....
Obj_Polygon : Flags a b c material-name
              Flags:  8 u-wrapping
                     16 v-wrapping
*_kf*Spline : tens cont bias easeto easefrom
*_kfRotData : quaternion : x,y,z,w. These have been preprocessed. 3DS
              saves the absolute axis/angles, not relative to last
              keyframe. I processed them, so I just need to interpolate
              throught these quat values to get correct rotation.
Cam_Flags : 1 active
Lig_Flags : 1 active
Lig_Type  : 1 omni
            2 spot
Lig_Strengt  : used in my own engine. Intensity of light Lig_MaxRange
                  : --"--                  range of influence

Also note that I have already fixed the object hierarchy (as much as I
need to get it working in my own engine, at least :)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I suggest you make your own parser, to convert the output file to a binary
file, and just skip the stuff you don't need.... This will result in a
MUCH smaller file!
Or you could ask me about the source to this. But you have to ask VERY
nicely if I should even consider it... :)

If there's anything you don't understand, or anything you miss or
something, just send me an email...!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I know there's a lot of stuf missing in the output file... This proggy is
more like a result of my own experimenting while making my own 3DS
loader. And I implemented only the stuff I needed as my engine evolved. I
have already included a lot more, and actually parses almost every single
chunk in the 3DS file...
I will release a new version as soon as I feel I have included everything
in the 3DS file format...
