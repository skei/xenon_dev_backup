  Here is the code I wrote to do cooperative multitasking in TP4, and have
since used in TP5, TP6, TP7. This version works with TP7, I make no
guarantees for earlier versions.

Unit Tasker;
{
  Non-Preemptive MultiTasking Unit
  for Turbo Pascal Version 4

  Author  : Michael Warot - Blue Star Systems
  Date    : November 1987
  Purpose : Simple multi-tasking for turbo pascal 4.0
  Version : 1.10

  V1.10  August    1988 MAW - After much modification, added LastP to
                              point to the highest numbered active process.
                              With MaxProc set to 30 and 2 tasks, took
                              effective yield time down from 240 uS to 38 uS
  V1.04  March     1988 MAW - Modify record used to save process, now
                              use a pointer instead of 2 words to save
                              the stack frame.
                              Eliminate redundant variable NextP
  V1.03  March,    1988 MAW - Modify code to save video state for a given
                              process. A flag Video_Save toggles this.
  V1.02  March,    1988 MAW - Modify code to support Sleep Function
                              Added procedures LOCK and UNLOCK to permit
                              use of non-reentrant procedures in programs
  V1.01  January,  1988 MAW - Remove obsolete startup function Init_Tasking.
                              Put in some documentation. Clean up code.
  V1.00  November, 1987 MAW - Initial version, simple and crude, but it works.

Implementation
{
  Hide this from the users....

  These procedures work on the following basis:
    1> For each process, there is an amount of memory reserved for
       a machine stack, this is called a Stack Frame. This holds
       the current state of a given process.

    2> The process table (Procs) contains pointers to all of the
       Stack Frames. When a task is to be swapped out, it's state
       is saved in it's own stack, then the frame pointer is placed
       in (Procs) until the process is to be swapped back in.

    3> Every one in a while, when a task has some time to share,
       it makes a call to Yield, which does all of the swapping.
