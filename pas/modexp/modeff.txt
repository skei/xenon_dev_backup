A description of each  effect and how it  is implemented is given  on the
following pages.  Once again, all values are given in  hexadecimal unless
otherwise stated.

컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
0: Arpeggio
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
If a note as an effect number of 0, it is only an arpeggio if there is at
least one non-zero argument.  When there is at least one  valid argument,
this effect means to  play the note specified,	then the note+xxxx	half-
steps, then the  note+yyyy half-steps,	and then return  to the  original
note.  These changes are evenly spaced	within the time for a line	to be
played at the current speed.

This effect is usually	used to simulate chords  (where a major chord  is
the note+4 half  steps and the	note+7 half-steps).   This does not  work
very well on  most samples.   This can also  be used  to produce a	heavy
vibrato.  Here is an example of this effect:

Note C-3, xxxx=4, yyyy=7

this will attempt to produce a C-major chord.  At the beginning of a line
the C-3 note is played, then at 1/3 of the way through	the line the note
is retriggered at E-3, 2/3 of  the way through it is retriggered  at G-3,
and at the beginning of the  next line (if there  are no new notes	to be
played on the channel), it is retriggered at C-3 again.

This presents a minor problem for timing, since you have to keep track of
the arpeggio during the course of playing  a line.	What you could	do is
use a  timer differently,  or set  up  another timer  that	independently
tracks the timing of the arpeggio.

컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
1: Slide up (Portamento Up)
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
This effect will  slide up	the frequency  (decrease the  period) of  the
sample being played on the channel by xxxxyyyy notes for every	tick that
occurs during the line.   You usually cannot  slide past note B-3  unless
you have implemented octave 4 (NON-STANDARD!).	The number of  ticks that
occur per line is set with effect  $F, the set speed command.	Since the
slide rate depends on  the speed, be careful  if you set are  composing a
MOD when you change the speed.	An example of this effect is:

Note C-3, xxxxyyyy = 2, playing at speed 3.

At the beginning of the line the sample is started at period C-3.  At the
first tick, the period is decremented by 2 (the frequency  is increased).
At the	second tick,  the period  is  again decremented  by  2.   At  the
beginning of the next line, if there is  not a new note to be  played the
period is again decremented by 2.

컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
2: Slide down (Portamento Down)
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
This effect will slide	down the frequency (increase  the period) of  the
sample being played on the channel by xxxxyyyy tones for every	tick that
occurs during the line.  You  usually cannot slide below note  C-1 unless
you have implemented octave 0 (NON-STANDARD!).	The number of  ticks that
occur per line is set with effect  $F, the set speed command.	Since the
slide rate depends on  the speed, be careful  if you set are  composing a
MOD when you change the speed.	An example of this effect is:

Note C-3, xxxxyyyy = 2, playing at speed 3.

At the beginning of the line the sample is started at period C-3.  At the
first tick, the period is incremented by 2 (the frequency  is decreased).
At the	second tick,  the period  is  again incremented  by  2.   At  the
beginning of the next line, if there is  not a new note to be  played the
period is again incremented by 2.

컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
3: Slide to note
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
This effect will slide	a note being played  on a channel to  a specified
note.  The parameter xxxxyyyy will states the speed at which a slide will
occur.	For each tick that	occurs during the line, the  period currently
being played is altered by the number of notes specified.  The	number of
ticks that occur per line is  set with effect $F, the set  speed command.
Since the slide  rate depends on  the speed,  be careful  if you set  are
composing a MOD when you change the speed.	An example of this effect is:

Slide to note C-2, xxxxyyyy = 2, playing at speed 3.

At the beginning  of the  line the current	frequency for  the sample  is
altered to	be 2  notes closer	to	C-2.   At the  first  tick, the  same
alteration occurs, changing the period to form a note even closer to C-2.
The same occurs for  each tick after that.	 This effect continues	until
another effect is started or the specified frequency is reached.

If a slide rate is not	specified (xxxxyyyy is zero) then the  last slide
rate used on the channel is used again.

컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
4: Vibrato
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
Vibrato means to "oscillate the sample pitch using a  particular waveform
with amplitude yyyy notes, such that (xxxx * speed)/64	full oscillations
occur in the line".  The waveform to use in vibrating is set using effect
E4 (see  below). By  placing vibrato  effects on  consecutive lines,  the
vibrato effect can be sustained for  any length of time.  If  either xxxx
or yyyy are 0,	then values from  the most recent  prior vibrato will  be
used.

An example is: Note C-3, with xxxx=8 and yyyy=1 when speed=6.	This will
play tones	around	C-3,  vibrating through  D-3  and  B-2 to  C-3	again
(amplitude - yyyy - is 1), with (8*6)/64 = 3/4 of a  full oscillation per
line.  Please see effect E4 for the waveform to use for vibrating.

컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
5: Continue effect 3:'Slide to note', but also do Volume slide
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
This effect will change the volume	of a channel while a  tone portamento
(effect 3) is taking place.  The values xxxx or yyyy specify the speed of
the volume change.	 If xxxx is nonzero  the volume is increased,  and if
yyyy is nonzero the volume is decreased.  It is illegal for both xxxx and
yyyy to be non-zero.  You cannot slide past 64 or below 0.

As an example, take  the xxxx to  be set to  3.  This  means that at  the
beginning of the line, the current volume of the channel is  increased by
3.	The volume	is increased again for	every tick on  this line and  the
lines following (until there  is a new effect).   Once again, the  volume
cannot slide up past 64.

컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
6: Continue effect 4:'Vibrato', but also do Volume slide
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
This effect will change the volume	of a channel while a  vibrato (effect
4) is taking place.   The values xxxx  or yyyy specify	the speed of  the
volume change.	If xxxx is	nonzero the volume is increased, and  if yyyy
is nonzero the volume is decreased.  It is illegal for both xxxx and yyyy
to be non-zero.  You cannot slide past 64 or below 0.

As an example, take  the yyyy to  be set to  2.  This  means that at  the
beginning of the line, the current volume of the channel is  decreased by
2.	The volume	is decreased again for	every tick on  this line and  the
lines following (until there  is a new effect).   Once again, the  volume
cannot slide down below 0.

컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
7: Tremolo
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
Temolo means to "oscillate the sample volume using a  particular waveform
with   amplitude   yyyy*(speed-1),	 such	that   (xxxx*speed)/64	 full
oscillations occur in the line".  The waveform to use to oscillate is set
using the  effect  E7  (see  below).	By	placing  tremolo  effects  on
consecutive lines, the tremolo effect can be sustained for any	length of
time.  If either  xxxx or yyyy are	0, then values	from the most  recent
prior tremolo will be used.

The usage of this effect is similar to that of effect 4:Vibrato.

컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
8: This effect is not used.
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
9: Set sample offset
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
This effect allows you to start a sample from a specified position rather
than the normal beginning position.   Multiply the value xxxxyyyy  by 512
to get	the position  in bytes	from the  beginning of	the sample	where
playback should start.	 If no sample is  specified with the effect,  but
one is	currently  playing on  the	channel,  then the	sample	currently
playing is retriggered to offset specified.

An example is instrument 2 being  played at note C-3,  with xxxxyyyy=$23.
This would make playback of the sample start at offset $23*$200  = $4600.
This effect gives a rough range to play the sample from.

컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
A: Volume slide
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
This effect  will change  the volume  of all  samples being  played on	a
channel.  The values xxxx or yyyy specify the speed of the volume change.
If xxxx is nonzero	the volume is increased,  and if yyyy is  nonzero the
volume is decreased.   It is illegal for  both xxxx and  yyyy to be  non-
zero.  You cannot slide past 64 or below 0.

As an example, take  the yyyy to  be set to  3.  This  means that at  the
beginning of the line, the current volume of the channel is  decreased by
3.	The volume is decreased  by 3 again for  every tick on this  line and
the lines  following (until  there is  a new  effect).	 Once again,  the
volume cannot slide down below 0.

컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
B: Position Jump
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
This effect xxxxyyyy parameter specifies a position in the	pattern table
that playback should jump  to after this line.	 Legal values are  in the
range of the number of patters that  are supposed to be in the	song (see
section 2.3).  Values outside this range should be ignored.

컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
C: Set volume
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
Effect C will set the volume on a channel to the setting specified by the
xxxxyyyy value.  Legal volumes are in the  range of 0 to 64.   An attempt
to set the volume to a higher value than 64 will just set it to 64.

I don't think we really need an example for this effect.

컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
D: Pattern Break
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
This effect is equivalent to a	position jump to the next pattern  in the
pattern table, with the arguments xxxx*10+yyyy specifying the line within
that pattern to start playing at.  Note that this is NOT xxxx*16+yyyy.

For example, the effect with  arguments xxxx=0, yyyy=0 would  simply jump
to the first line in the next pattern in the pattern table	after playing
the current line.	With arguments	xxxx=1 and yyyy=6  would jump to  the
16th line of  the next	pattern in the	pattern table  after playing  the
current line.

컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
E0: Set filter on/off
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
This sets a hardware sound filter to ON (if yyyy is 0) or OFF (if xxxx is
nonzero).  If your sound device  has built-in filters, you	should ignore
this effect command.  This effect is primarily used on Amiga 500 and 2000
computers to dick around with the hardware filter.

컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
E1: Fineslide up
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
This effect functions just	like effect 1, except  that the frequency  of
the sample is only modified once.	At the beginning of a  line, whatever
frequency is being	played on  a channel  is incremented  by yyyy  notes.
This effect does NOT continue on  the lines following.	You  cannot slide
the frequency above the  note B-3 (unless you  implement octave 4 :  NON-
STANDARD!).

An example here would be effect  E, xxxx=1 (the extended  effect number),
yyyy=3.  This  would slide the	current frequency up  three notes at  the
beginning of the line.

컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
E2: Fineslide down
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
This effect functions just	like effect 2, except  that the frequency  of
the sample is only modified once.	At the beginning of a  line, whatever
frequency is being	played on  a channel  is decremented  by yyyy  notes.
This effect does NOT continue on  the lines following.	You  cannot slide
the frequency below the  note C-1 (unless you  implement octave 0 :  NON-
STANDARD!).

An example here would be effect  E, xxxx=1 (the extended  effect number),
yyyy=2.  This  would slide the	current frequency down	two notes at  the
beginning of the line.

컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
E3: Set glissando on/off
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
The argument yyyy to this  effect specifies whether the  glissando effect
is ON (yyyy  is 1) or  OFF (yyyy is  0).   If glissando  is on, then  the
'Slide to note' will  slide a half note  at a time.   Otherwise, it  will
perform the default smooth slide.

컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
E4: Set vibrato waveform
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
This effect means to set the waveform appearance for succeeding 'vibrato'
effects.  There  are currently	four possible appearances  for the	wave,
each with a possible  'retrigger'.  Two cycles  are shown below for  each
type of waveform:
											 yyyy
	Waveform   Name 			   Retriggered	No Retrigger
	컴컴컴컴   컴컴컴컴컴컴컴	   컴컴컴컴컴	컴컴컴컴컴컴
	/\	/\	   Sine (default)			0			 4
	  \/  \/

	|\ |\	   Ramp down				1			 5
	  \| \|

	,-, ,-,    Square					2			 6
	  '-' '-'

	?????????  Random					3			 7

A "retriggered" waveform will  be reset to  the start of  a cycle at  the
beginning of each new note.   If a wave is selected  "without retrigger",
the  previous  waveform  will  be  continued.	 Waveforms	 are  usually
retriggered.

컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
E5: Set finetune value
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
This effect command sets the finetune value for the current instrument to
the signed nibble value  yyyy.	This value	overrides the value found  in
the sample information block at the  beginning of the MOD file.   The new
finetune remains until changed by another E5 effect.

		   Value:  7  6  5	4  3  2  1	0  F  E  D	C  B  A  9	8
 Finetune to set: +7 +6 +5 +4 +3 +2 +1	0 -1 -2 -3 -4 -5 -6 -7 -8

This effect  is implemented  by storing  period values	for all  possible
finetunes, and simply switching to a different table of periods when this
effect is encountered.	See section 3.3 for more information.	Section 4
lists the period tables for finetunes for octaves 1 to 3.

컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴-
E6: Loop pattern
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴-
This effect  allows a  section of  a pattern  to be  'looped', or  played
through, a certain number of times in succession.  If the effect argument
yyyy is zero, the effect specifies the loop's start point.  Otherwise, it
specifies the number of times to play this line and the  preceeding lines
from the start point.	If no  start point was	specified in the  current
pattern being played, the  loop start defaults to  the first line in  the
pattern.  Therefore, you cannot loop through multiple patterns.

An example:

On line 3,	the effect E6  is encountered, with  yyyy=0.  This	specifies
that line 3 is the beginning of a loop in this pattern.
Down on line 52, the effect  E6 is encountered again, with yyyy=2.	 This
means to jump back and play the lines from line 3 to  line 52 again twice
more before continuing with the rest of the pattern.

컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴-
E7: Set tremolo waveform
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴-
Line command  E4,  this  sets  the	waveform  appearance  for  succeeding
'tremolo'  (volume)  effects.     There   are  currently  four   possible
appearances for the wave, each with  a possible 'retrigger'.   Two cycles
are shown below for each type of waveform:
											 yyyy
	Waveform   Name 			   Retriggered	No Retrigger
	컴컴컴컴   컴컴컴컴컴컴컴	   컴컴컴컴컴	컴컴컴컴컴컴
	/\	/\	   Sine (default)			0			 4
	  \/  \/

	|\ |\	   Ramp down				1			 5
	  \| \|

	,-, ,-,    Square					2			 6
	  '-' '-'

	?????????  Random					3			 7

A "retriggered" waveform will  be reset to  the start of  a cycle at  the
beginning of each new note.   If a wave is selected  "without retrigger",
the  previous  waveform  will  be  continued.	 Waveforms	 are  usually
retriggered.

컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
E8: This effect is not used.
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
E9: Retrigger sample
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
Effect E9 allows  you to re-trigger  a specified  sample at a  particular
note after yyyy  ticks during the  line.   For example,  say note C-3  is
specified, with yyyy=2 when  the speed is currently  6.  This would  mean
that at the beginning  of the line the	specified sample is started,  and
after two ticks it is restarted.   This continues until the  beginning of
the next line.	This effect is used mostly with samples of hi-hats.

컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴-
EA: Fine volume slide up
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴-
This effect increments	the volume of  a particular  channel once at  the
beginning of the line  by yyyy points.	 There is no continuation  of the
slide on successive  lines or for  other notes.   You cannot slide	above
volume 64.

컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴-
EB: Fine volume slide down
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴-
This effect is	just like  effect EA,  except the  volume is  decremented
rather than incremented by the value  yyyy.  There is no  continuation of
the slide on successive lines or for other notes.  You cannot slide below
volume 0.

컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴-
EC: Cut sample
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴-
This effect sets the  volume of the  sample which is  playing to 0	after
yyyy ticks in the current line.  This has the effect of stopping a sample
abruptly.  An example here	is to play the	note C-2, with effect  EC and
argument yyyy=3, when the speed is 6.  The sample is started  at note C-2
at the beginning of the line, and after the third tick of 6 in that line,
the volume on the  channel is set to  0 (cutting it off).	Note that  if
yyyy is 0, nothing will be heard.

컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴-
ED: Delay sample
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴-
This effect delays the start of  a sample until tick yyyy in  the current
line.  For example,  if note C-2 is  played, with effect ED  and argument
yyyy=3 when the speed is 6.   The note C-2	will be triggered at  the 3rd
tick after the start of the line.  The purpose of this effect is to delay
the start of a sample for a VERY short amount of time.

컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴-
EE: Delay pattern
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴-
This effect  forces a  small delay	in a  pattern  in between  successive
lines.	All notes and effects  continue during this delay.	 The argument
yyyy specified the number of  line-equivalent time slices to  wait before
resuming playback.	For example, if  effect EE is encountered  with speed
being 6 and argument yyyy=4, then the next line will be delayed  24 ticks
before it is executed.

This effect is used on the Amiga to play samples backward at  a specified
speed.	It is not really  feasible to implement on	other architechtures,
and it is not used that often.

F: Set speed
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴-
This effect changes the  speed of playback so  that xxxxyyyy ticks	occur
during every line, starting on the NEXT line.  The initial	speed (before
any 'set speed' effects are encountered) should be set to 6.   A value of
xxxxyyyy=0 should technically cause playback  to stop, but this  value is
commonly ignored as garbage.

Valid values for speed setting in this manner are 1 to 31.	If a value is
read that is above 31,	it means to set  a modified speed based  on beats
per minute, where 4 lines are  1 beat.	This means	that if I try  to set
the speed to 42, I am  specifying 42 beats per minute, or  42*4=168 lines
per minute.    You then  have  to  figure out  how	long  to spend	on	a
particular line.

If multiple set speed  effects are performed on  a single line, then  the
effects on the higher-numbered channels have precedence over  the effects
on the lower-numbered channels.

This effect has the largest  number of implementations and	is particular
to the number of effects that a particular file player supports.
